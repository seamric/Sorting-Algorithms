# Sorting-Algorithms
This project will dig into the working mechanics, time and space complexities of all the popular sorting algorithms

Sorting is the process of arranging items in a specific sequence. Sorting Algorithms are used to arrange data sets into ascending or descending orders. Efficient Sorting
Algorithms are an absolute necessity to create other efficient algorithms like
Searching Algorithms. For example:

For a input of  5 numbers 	
74, 45, 65, -24, -38

The output in Ascending Sorted order 	is : 
-38, -24, 45, 65, 74

There are varios types of Sorting Algorithms :
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
